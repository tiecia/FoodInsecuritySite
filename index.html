            <ul class=descList>
                <li>High food security: no reported indications of food-access problems or limitations.</li>
                <li>Marginal food security: one or two reported indications-typically of anxiety over food sufficiency or shortage of food in the house. Little or no indication of changes in diets or food intake.</li>
                <li>Low food security: reports of reduced quality, variety or desirability of diet. Little or no indication of reduced food intake.</li>

            <p class=newParagraph>The residents of the Logan neighborhood in Spokane, Washington suffer from many compounding factors that make is difficult for them to have reliable food access. Most residents live over 0.5 miles from a supermarket and many residents cannot afford cars meaning they must walk to and from the store carrying their groceries. This can be dangerous especially in the winter and when residents are forced to go late at night. Moreover, the presence of only one supermarket within walking distance means prices are unfairly high, thus forcing financially strained residents to purchase less food.</p>
